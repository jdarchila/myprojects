#5. Divisible By Ten
#Finally, letâ€™s make things a bit more challenging! We are going to create a function that determines whether or not a number is divisible by ten. A number is divisible by ten if the remainder of the number divided by 10 is 0. Using this, we can complete this function in a few steps:

#Define the function header to accept one input num
#Calculate the remainder of the input divided by 10 (use modulus)
#Use an if statement to check if the remainder was 0. If the remainder was 0, return True, otherwise, return False

#Create a function called divisible_by_ten() that has one parameter named num.

#The function should return True if num is divisible by 10, and False otherwise. Consider using modulo operator % to check for divisibility.

def divisible_by_ten(num):
    num % 10 
    if num % 10 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
#Example
print(divisible_by_ten(20)) # True
print(divisible_by_ten(25)) # False

#For the next code challenge, letâ€™s add functions to the mix! We create a function that tests whether the result of taking the power of one number to another number provides an answer that is greater than 5000. We will use a conditional statement to return True if the result is greater than 5000 or return False if it is not. In order to accomplish this, we will need the following steps:

#Define the function to accept two input parameters called base and exponent
#Calculate the result of base to the power of exponent
#Use an if statement to test if the result is greater than 5000. If it is then return True. Otherwise, return False

# Write your large_power function here:

def large_power(base, exponent):
    base ** exponent
    if base ** exponent > 5000:
        return True
    else:
        return False
    
print(large_power(2, 12))
print(large_power(2, 13))
print(large_power(40, 20))

    <h2>Me as a developer...</h2>
    <p>
      I'm at the start of my journey as a developer, but I've already found real passion in building, learning, and creating. Alongside coding, I've been growing my skills as a software tester and accessibility analyst—making sure digital experiences work smoothly for everyone. I might be new to development, but I know I'm on the right path. Every bug I catch, every line I write, and every tool I explore gets me one step closer to becoming really good at what I do.
